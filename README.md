## Hello, my name is Rychard Barros.👋

I am a 20-year-old software developer from Fortaleza, Brazil. In 2018, I was introduced to the world of development while studying in school and completing my technical degree in Computer Networking. Since then, I have been an avid admirer of technology and innovation, constantly seeking to learn and improve my skills as a developer. I am excited to contribute to open source projects and work on interesting development challenges.
